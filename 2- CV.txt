CV Length Myth:
  There's a widespread belief that a CV should be one page, but this is not always correct.
  The ideal CV length depends on factors like job type and experience level.  
  A one-page CV is only suitable if: 
    You Have very little experience.
    You are a high-profile industry leader (e.g., Elon Musk, Steve Jobs).  
The Purpose of a CV:
  A CV is your first impression; recruiters judge you based on it before any interview.  
  It should: 
    Capture attention and provide clear, relevant information about your skills and experience. 
Why Short CVs Can Hurt You: 
  One page CV can lead to ignore writing important informatrion like: 
    Definition of a company you worked in... 
    Important achievements... 
    Summary section... 
  The recruiter won't spend time researching about the companies or universities on your CV.
    So you should mention these kind of info.
  A vague, one-page CV with little detail can result in immediate rejection.  
AI and Automated CV Screening:
  Many companies now use AI and machine learning to filter CVs before recruiters even see them. 
  If your CV lacks relevant keywords (e.g., “Node.js” for a backend role).
    It might get a low score and be automatically rejected.  
How to Optimize Your CV for AI Screening:
  Include all relevant skills and technologies mentioned in the job description.  
  Ensure your experience section is detailed.
    Including specific technologies, frameworks, and project details.  
  Use clear job titles and responsibilities that match industry standards.  
Structuring Your CV Properly:
  Every section should provide valuable information.  
  Clearly state education, work experience, and skills with measurable achievements.  
  If you have mentored or trained others, mention it.
    As teamwork and knowledge-sharing are highly valued.  
  Include links to projects, GitHub repositories, or technical blogs if applicable.  
Key Takeaways:
  Tailor your CV for both human recruiters and AI-based screening systems.  
  Highlight relevant experience, technologies, and achievements clearly.  
  Use keywords from the job description to improve your chances of passing automated filters.  
  Things to add if you have:
