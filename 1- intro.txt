  The first interview, it's called HR Interview.
    It's actually not an HR interview, the HR -human resources- isn't involved at all in this step.
  An optional phase called technical assessment.
  Technical screening, it's usually done through a phone call:
    It can vary from one company to another and one position to another, like:
      You may have one problem solving question, or two.
      You may have one interview or two in this step.
      You may have question related to the system design or management.
  Full loop interview -Last Stage-:
    It contains multiple phases:
      Technical screening:
        Similar to the technical phone screening but: 
          It has more details and maybe it will be harder.
      System design:
        According to your experience.
      Behavioral interview:
        It's maybe a separate interview or it's a part of each interview.
  Offer negotiation, how to make sure that the salary and the culture is right for you.
